## [1.3.6] - 2025-10-07

### ‚ú® Enhancement - Additional STIX 2.1 Relationship Types

This release adds 8 additional STIX 2.1 relationship types that were missing from the vocabulary, ensuring complete coverage of the official specification.

### Added
- **Additional STIX 2.1 Relationship Types** (RelationshipTypes.java)
  - Added 8 missing relationship types to SDO vocabulary:
    - `based-on` - Used by Indicator objects to show derivation relationships
    - `communicates-with` - Used by Infrastructure and Malware objects for network communications
    - `delivers` - Used by Infrastructure, Malware, and Tool objects for payload delivery
    - `hosts` - Used by Infrastructure, Intrusion Set, Malware, and Threat Actor objects
    - `prevents` - Used by Course of Action objects to indicate prevention capabilities
    - `similar` - Used by Attack Pattern objects to show similarity relationships
    - `owns` - Ownership relationships between STIX objects
    - `leverages` - Used to indicate leveraging of capabilities or resources
  - Total relationship types now: 40+ (35 SDO types, 2 SCO types, 3 common types)

### Technical Impact
- Ensures complete STIX 2.1 specification compliance for relationship types
- Enables creation of all standard STIX 2.1 relationship patterns
- Improves interoperability with other STIX 2.1 implementations
- Prevents validation failures for standard relationship types

### Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Full STIX 2.1 specification compliance
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing code
- ‚úÖ All standard STIX 2.1 relationship types now supported

## [1.3.5] - 2025-10-07

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Missing Relationship Types

This release fixes a critical production issue where the "resolves-to" relationship type was not defined in the RelationshipTypes vocabulary, causing 500 errors when creating domain-to-IP relationships.

### Fixed
- **Missing STIX 2.1 Relationship Types** (RelationshipTypes.java)
  - Added comprehensive list of all STIX 2.1 relationship types (32+ types)
  - Organized relationship types into three categories:
    - **SDO Relationship Types** (27 types): targets, uses, attributed-to, mitigates, indicates, variant-of, impersonates, compromises, originates-from, investigates, remediates, located-at, consists-of, controls, belongs-to, beacons-to, exfiltrates-to, downloads, drops, exploits, characterizes, analysis-of, static-analysis-of, dynamic-analysis-of, authored-by, operates-on, has
    - **SCO Relationship Types** (2 types): resolves-to, contains
    - **Common Relationship Types** (3 types): duplicate-of, derived-from, related-to
  - Critical fix: Added "resolves-to" for domain-to-IP observable relationships
  - Updated getAllTerms() to properly merge all three categories

### Technical Impact
- Fixes 500 errors in STIX service when creating observable relationships
- Enables proper domain-to-IP relationship creation with "resolves-to" type
- Provides complete STIX 2.1 relationship vocabulary as per specification
- Prevents validation failures for standard STIX 2.1 relationship types

### Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Full STIX 2.1 specification compliance
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing code
- ‚úÖ All relationship types from STIX 2.1 spec now supported

## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-07

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Timestamp Serialization

This release fixes a critical timestamp serialization issue where STIX objects were producing invalid JSON output when used in Spring Boot applications.

### Fixed
- **Timestamp Serialization Issue** (StixInstant.java, StixBoolean.java)
  - Added `@JsonSerialize` and `@JsonDeserialize` annotations directly to `StixInstant` and `StixBoolean` classes
  - Fixes issue where timestamps were serialized as objects instead of ISO 8601 strings
  - Ensures proper serialization in Spring Boot REST APIs that use their own ObjectMapper
  - Before: `"created": {"instant": "2025-10-07T16:33:18.310485596Z", "originalSubSecondPrecisionDigitCount": 3}`
  - After: `"created": "2025-10-07T16:33:18.310Z"`

### Technical Impact
- Custom serializers now work automatically in all Jackson contexts
- No need to manually configure Spring Boot applications with `StixParsers` modules
- Maintains STIX 2.1 specification compliance for timestamp formats
- Fixes Docker deployments and REST API integrations

### Added
- **Comprehensive Serialization Compliance Test Suite**
  - New `SerializationComplianceTest.java` with 6 tests covering all serialization scenarios
  - Validates timestamps serialize as ISO 8601 strings
  - Verifies Bundle objects array is properly included
  - Checks all SDO types for proper serialization
  - Ensures full STIX 2.1 specification compliance

### Verified
- **Complete Serialization Audit**
  - Audited all custom wrapper types (`StixInstant`, `StixBoolean`)
  - Verified all specialized collection serializers (`CyberObservableSetFieldSerializer`, `CyberObservableExtensionsFieldSerializer`)
  - Confirmed all value objects have proper Jackson annotations
  - Tested all 77 tests pass with no serialization issues
  - Validated compliance across all STIX 2.1 object types (SDO, SRO, COO)

### Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Spring Boot 2.x and 3.x compatible
- ‚úÖ Works with any Jackson ObjectMapper configuration
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing code
- ‚úÖ Full STIX 2.1 specification compliance verified
- ‚úÖ No further serialization issues expected

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-07

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Bundle Serialization

This release fixes a critical serialization issue that prevented Bundle objects from properly serializing in REST APIs.

### Fixed
- **BundleObject Serialization Issue** (BundleObject.java:63)
  - Removed `JsonProperty.Access.WRITE_ONLY` from `objects` field
  - Fixes issue where `objects` array was completely omitted from JSON output
  - Restores proper Bundle serialization for REST APIs and Docker deployments
  - Ensures `objects` field is included in JSON responses

### Technical Impact
- **Before**: Bundles serialized without the `objects` array
- **After**: Bundles properly include all STIX objects in serialization
- Fixes Docker image builds that rely on proper Bundle serialization
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Migration Guide

### Migrating from 0.3.0 to 1.0.0

No breaking changes. The following improvements have been made:

1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is now available in the `docs/` directory
2. **License**: Changed to BSD 2-Clause (update your license compliance if needed)
3. **Stability**: All critical bugs fixed, production ready

### Migrating from 0.2.0 to 1.0.0

1. **STIX Version**: Library now correctly reports STIX 2.1 (was 2.0)
2. **Validation**: Stricter validation of vocabulary terms
3. **Required Fields**: Some objects now properly enforce required fields

Example migration:
```java
// Old (might have worked incorrectly)
Report report = Report.builder()
    .name("Report")
    .published(new StixInstant())
    // Missing required label!
    .build();

// New (correct)
Report report = Report.builder()
    .name("Report")
    .published(new StixInstant())
    .addLabel("threat-report")  // Now required
    .build();
```

### Migrating from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

Major changes required:

1. **Bundle Creation**: Use builder methods instead of direct manipulation
```java
// Old (didn't work)
Bundle bundle = Bundle.builder().build();
// Could not add objects!

// New
Bundle bundle = Bundle.builder()
    .addObject(indicator)
    .addObject(malware)
    .build();
```

2. **Vocabulary Classes**: Update any custom vocabulary implementations
3. **Validation**: Handle ValidationException for invalid STIX objects
